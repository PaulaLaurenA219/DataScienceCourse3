For the creation of the tidyData.txt only the variables with the mean and associated standard deviation were used.  
There are 68 variables in the tidyData.txt and a total of 180 records that provide an average of the 66 variables for each activity and subject.  

Tranformations on the data consisted of aggregating all of the activity level measurement per each subject in the form of the average.
This was performed on the raw mean data and raw standard deviation data.   

For the descriptions of the 68 variables please see CodeBook.pdf.
